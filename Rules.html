    <p>For all Kodemonkies there is as always only one rule:</p>
    <h2> Above all, be Cool!</h2>

    <p>However some basic house keeping rules are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No Bullying </li>
      <li>No Lying</li>
      <li>No Wasting peoples time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To enable this it is up to KodemonkeyDojo Champions to take certain necessary steps and allow the Kodemonkies this unique creative freedom.</p>

    <p>This document details a set of guiding principles that the CoderDojo Foundation recommends all individual Dojos meet. The principles set out in this
    document may be amended at any stage through a consultation process with the Community or Advisory Committee.</p>

    <h2>What is the Recommended Practice?</h2>

    <p>The recommended practice for all Dojos is a set of 5 guiding principles that Dojos can choose to meet. Due to the global nature of CoderDojo these
    principles have been designed to be user friendly and applicable to Dojos regardless of their geographical location.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Creating a safe space</li>
      <li>Safeguarding Children</li>
      <li>Encompassing the ethos</li>
      <li>Communication & Review</li>
      <li>Privacy and Data Protection</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is important to note that for ninjas there is only The one rule of CoderDojo; Be Cool. However us adults need to take further steps to
    ensure that we create safe spaces for ninjas to enjoy themselves. The Recommended Practice has been developed to act as a guide for Dojos in
    regards to standards to meet.</p>

    <h2>How does this affect the CoderDojo Charter?</h2>

    <p>The CoderDojo Charter was brought in in December 2013. Since then all Dojos who want to listed on the website must agree to the basic ethos
    encompassed in the Charter, this does not change. Recommended Practice is a set further, and is for Dojos who want to meet industry best practice
    standards.</p>

    <p><strong>What is the Recommended Practice trying to achieve?</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> To introduce a level of quality control across Dojos regardless of geographical region.</li>
      <li><strong>Safeguarding Children:</strong> All Dojos should be safe spaces for children, the RP ensures that Dojos meet child protection standards and guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Brand Protection:</strong> To protect the CoderDojo brand by ensuring that individual Dojos do not damage it for the wider community through negligence or naivety.</li>
      <li><strong>Representation:</strong> To enable the Foundation to legitimately represent a group of Dojos on an international level enabling partnerships with international companies to be negotiated.</li>
      <li><strong>Process & Guidance:</strong> To give Dojos looking to start up a structured process to follow. Dojos choosing to align will receive more active guidance and support from the Foundation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sense of Community & involvement:</strong> To create a greater sense of community between the Foundation & Dojos through enabling those meeting RP to become a member of the Foundation and  have a say in the running of the organisation.</li></li>
    </ol>

    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits for Dojos in meeting RP</h2>

    <p>A Dojo who chooses to meet the RP is making a public declaration that they are committed to best practices and child protection. The Foundation is
    currently in the process of altering its structure to allow Dojos meeting RP the ability to join as a member, automatically giving them certain rights
    in the running of the Foundation. There is no cost to become a member of the foundation.</p>

    <p>There are a number of additional benefits for Dojos such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognition as a Dojo that meets the highest quality standards through aligning with Recommended Practice.</li>
      <li>Dojos will have a voice in the operations of the Foundation and the ability to actively shape the direction and future of the global CoderDojo movement through this.</li>
      <li>Access to partnerships negotiated by the Foundation; such as Google & Raspberry Pi partnership negotiated for all UK Dojos and Coderstarter pilot partnership offering laptops for US Dojos to reach out to underserved attendees.</li>
      <li>Access to sponsorship and partnership opportunities such negotiated by the Foundation such as Coolest Projects Travel for European Dojos</li>
      <li>Option to attend regular Foundation organised events such as Coolest Projects and DojoCon as well as option of attending once off high profile events that may be organised in your area eg. Recent Dojo at Westminster Abbey, upcoming Dojo at Buckingham Palace.</li>
      <li>Official affiliation with a globally recognised brand and community network opening opportunities in local areas for support and sponsorship.</li>
      <li>Access to upcoming Foundation facilitated remote projects between international Dojos working in collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compliance with RP</h2>

    <p>The process in which the Foundation will monitor compliance with RP has yet to be fully designed. However based on initial research the Foundation will
    not actively enforce meeting the principles, instead a Dojo will be trusted that they are meeting RP if claiming to do so. Dojos may be asked to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sign a one page copy of the principles document to confirm their understanding of the principles</li>
      <li>Dojos may need to provide certain proof via email to the Foundation, i.e proof of vetting, insurance cert etc</li>
      <li>Before officially being recognised as meeting RP Dojos will be required to have a call with member of team or join Community Call</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Annually the Foundation will complete a survey of global Dojos. The purpose of this will be to ensure Dojos originally met RP are continuing to do so
    and to clean out inactive Dojos to ensure that Foundation maintains an active Dojo count.</p>
